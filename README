==== Git Remote Branch Thorified ====

This is a pointless project. I wanted to try out thor (http://github.com/wycats/thor) and so I decided to rewrite the excellent git_remote_branch (http://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch) by Mathieu Martin with it.

It lacks these features from git_remote_branch:
- explain command
- it does not output the command being executed
- absolutely no tests. Use at your own risk
- no alias for commands

It requires more keystrokes:
grb create branch vs. thor grb:create branch

It however provides all the cool features that thor ..hum.. provides. I'm not exactly sure what these are yet, but I'll guess:
- no need for options parsing code
- no need to create a gem

==== Installation ====

- gem install thor
- thor install http://github.com/jfcouture/git_remote_branch_thorified/tree/master/git_remote_branch.rb?raw=true

==== Help ====

- thor list
